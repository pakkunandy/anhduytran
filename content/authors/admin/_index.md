I am a Ph.D. student in the research group [DistriNet](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/) at the Computer Science Department of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven) under the supervision of [Prof. Wouter Joosen](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/WouterJoosen) and [Dr. Koean Yskout](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/KoenYskout). My research focuses include various subjects in Computer and System Security, mostly in Software Security, Computer and Multimedia Forensics, Malware Analysis, Mobile Security, and Privacy. I obtained a Diplôme d’ingénieur (Master of Science in Engineering) in Communication System Security at EURECOM and Télécom Paris in France. My Master’s thesis is about Memory Forensics under the supervision of [Prof. Davide Balzarotti](https://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/. I am the founder of the Computer Security Club at the University of Science, VNU-HCM. I sometimes play CTF with the codename `pakkunandy`, and I also host HCMUS-CTF every year.

My research style is interdisciplinary in general. I am leveraging many techniques and knowledge from many domains to tackle real-world security-related problems and design secured systems. I am currently involved in Multimedia Verification projects with [Assoc.Prof. Dang-Nguyen Duc-Tien](https://dnductien.github.io/).
